# - Find Corrade
#
# Basic usage:
#  find_package(Corrade [REQUIRED])
# This module tries to find Corrade library and then defines:
#  CORRADE_FOUND                    - True if Corrade is found
#  CORRADE_INCLUDE_DIR              - Root include dir
#  CORRADE_INTERCONNECT_LIBRARIES   - Interconnect library and dependent
#   libraries
#  CORRADE_UTILITY_LIBRARIES        - Utility library and dependent
#   libraries
#  CORRADE_PLUGINMANAGER_LIBRARIES  - PluginManager library and dependent
#   libraries
#  CORRADE_TESTSUITE_LIBRARIES      - TestSuite library and dependent
#   libraries
#  CORRADE_RC_EXECUTABLE            - Resource compiler executable
#  CORRADE_LIB_SUFFIX_MODULE        - Path to CorradeLibSuffix.cmake module
# The package is found if either debug or release version of each library is
# found. If both debug and release libraries are found, proper version is
# chosen based on actual build configuration of the project (i.e. Debug build
# is linked to debug libraries, Release build to release libraries).
#
# On multi-configuration build systems (such as Visual Studio or XCode) the
# preprocessor variable CORRADE_IS_DEBUG_BUILD is defined if given build
# configuration is Debug (not Corrade itself, but build configuration of the
# project using it). Useful e.g. for selecting proper plugin directory. On
# single-configuration build systems (such as Makefiles) this information is
# not needed and thus the variable is not defined in any case.
#
# Corrade configures the compiler to use C++11 standard (if it is not already
# configured to do so). Additionally you can use CORRADE_CXX_FLAGS to enable
# additional pedantic set of warnings and enable hidden visibility by default.
#
# Features of found Corrade library are exposed in these variables:
#  CORRADE_GCC47_COMPATIBILITY  - Defined if compiled with compatibility
#   mode for GCC 4.7
#  CORRADE_GCC46_COMPATIBILITY  - Defined if compiled with compatibility
#   mode for GCC 4.6
#  CORRADE_GCC45_COMPATIBILITY  - Defined if compiled with compatibility
#   mode for GCC 4.5
#  CORRADE_GCC44_COMPATIBILITY  - Defined if compiled with compatibility
#   mode for GCC 4.4
#  CORRADE_MSVC2013_COMPATIBILITY - Defined if compiled with compatibility
#   mode for MSVC 2013
#  CORRADE_MSVC2015_COMPATIBILITY - Defined if compiled with compatibility
#   mode for MSVC 2015
#  CORRADE_BUILD_DEPRECATED     - Defined if compiled with deprecated APIs
#   included
#  CORRADE_BUILD_STATIC         - Defined if compiled as static libraries
#  CORRADE_TARGET_UNIX          - Defined if compiled for some Unix flavor
#   (Linux, BSD, OS X)
#  CORRADE_TARGET_APPLE         - Defined if compiled for OS X
#  CORRADE_TARGET_WINDOWS       - Defined if compiled for Windows
#  CORRADE_TARGET_NACL          - Defined if compiled for Google Chrome
#   Native Client
#  CORRADE_TARGET_NACL_NEWLIB   - Defined if compiled for Google Chrome
#   Native Client with `newlib` toolchain
#  CORRADE_TARGET_NACL_GLIBC    - Defined if compiled for Google Chrome
#   Native Client with `glibc` toolchain
#  CORRADE_TARGET_EMSCRIPTEN    - Defined if compiled for Emscripten
#  CORRADE_TARGET_ANDROID       - Defined if compiled for Android
#
# Corrade provides these macros and functions:
#
#
# Add unit test using Corrade's TestSuite.
#  corrade_add_test(test_name
#                   sources...
#                   [LIBRARIES libraries...])
# Test name is also executable name. You can also specify libraries to link
# with instead of using target_link_libraries(). CORRADE_TESTSUITE_LIBRARIES
# are linked automatically to each test. Note that the enable_testing()
# function must be called explicitly.
#
#
# Compile data resources into application binary.
#  corrade_add_resource(name resources.conf)
# Depends on corrade-rc, which is part of Corrade utilities. This command
# generates resource data using given configuration file in current build
# directory. Argument name is name under which the resources can be explicitly
# loaded. Variable `name` contains compiled resource filename, which is then
# used for compiling library / executable. Example usage:
#  corrade_add_resource(app_resources resources.conf)
#  add_executable(app source1 source2 ... ${app_resources})
#
# Add dynamic plugin.
#  corrade_add_plugin(plugin_name debug_install_dir release_install_dir
#                     metadata_file sources...)
# The macro adds preprocessor directive CORRADE_DYNAMIC_PLUGIN. Additional
# libraries can be linked in via target_link_libraries(plugin_name ...). If
# debug_install_dir is set to CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR (e.g. for testing
# purposes), the files are copied directly, without the need to perform install
# step. Note that the files are actually put into configuration-based
# subdirectory, i.e. ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}. See
# documentation of CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR variable for more information.
#
#
# Add static plugin.
#  corrade_add_static_plugin(plugin_name install_dir metadata_file
#                            sources...)
# The macro adds preprocessor directive CORRADE_STATIC_PLUGIN. Additional
# libraries can be linked in via target_link_libraries(plugin_name ...). If
# install_dir is set to CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR (e.g. for testing purposes),
# no installation rules are added.
#
# Note that plugins built in debug configuration (e.g. with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
# set to Debug) have "-d" suffix to make it possible to have both debug and
# release plugins installed alongside each other.
#
#
# Additionally these variables are defined for internal usage:
#  CORRADE_INTERCONNECT_LIBRARY     - Interconnect library (w/o
#   dependencies)
#  CORRADE_UTILITY_LIBRARY          - Utility library (w/o dependencies)
#  CORRADE_PLUGINMANAGER_LIBRARY    - Plugin manager library (w/o
#   dependencies)
#  CORRADE_TESTSUITE_LIBRARY        - TestSuite library (w/o dependencies)
#  CORRADE_*_LIBRARY_DEBUG          - Debug version of given library, if found
#  CORRADE_*_LIBRARY_RELEASE        - Release version of given library, if
#                                     found
#  CORRADE_USE_MODULE               - Path to UseCorrade.cmake module (included
#                                     automatically)
