/** @namespace Magnum::BulletIntegration
@brief Integration with Bullet Physics

Conversion of matrix and vector classes, wrappers for rigid body dynamics.

This library depends on **Bullet Physics** library and it is built if
`WITH_BULLET` is enabled when building Magnum Integration. To use
this library, you need to request `Bullet` component of `MagnumIntegration`
package in CMake, add `${MAGNUM_BULLETINTEGRATION_INCLUDE_DIRS}` to include
path and link to `${MAGNUM_BULLETINTEGRATION_LIBRARIES}`. See
@ref building-integration and @ref cmake-integration for more information.

/** @namespace Magnum::OvrIntegration
@brief Integration with the Oculus SDK (LibOVR)

Conversion of math classes, wrappers for most OVR CAPI structures and functions.

This library depends on **Oculus SDK 0.7.0.0-beta** and is built if `WITH_OVR`
is enabled when building Magnum Integration. To use this library, you need to
request `Ovr` component of `MagnumIntegration` package in CMake, add
`${MAGNUM_OVRINTEGRATION_INCLUDE_DIRS}` to include path and link to
`${MAGNUM_OVRINTEGRATION_LIBRARIES}`. See @ref building-integration and
@ref cmake-integration for more information.
